? - is the wildcard

Upper Bounded: List<? extends Cls>  :
        - lets you give to the list any type that is a subtype of "Cls" (any child class of "Cls")
        Another example for upper bound:
             public <T extends Person> void method(final List<T> persons) {...};
                    similar with:
             public void method(final List<? extends Person> persons> {...};


Lower Bounded: List<? super Cls>
         - lets you give to the List anythings of type "Cls" or anything that's a parent of "Cls"


Unbounded: List<?>
                equivalent with
           List<? extends Object>
           - it is not equivalent with List<Object>.
           - basically List<?> says that it could be any class, i just don't know which now
           - need to do further investigation about this
